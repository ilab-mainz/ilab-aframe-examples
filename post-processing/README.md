# A-Frame Effects

**Demo showing various shader effects**

## Note
- This uses the [aframe-effects](https://github.com/wizgrav/aframe-effects) component
- We are using [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) (or altenatively [gitcdn.link](http://gitcdn.link)) as a Content-Delivery-Network.  
  (to provide the scripts with the correct MIME-types)
- We need to use the a-frame version hosted at the repo :(
- The component allows for scriptable / embedded shaders

## Usage
  
- Use the checkboxes to toggle individual effects
